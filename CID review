## Introduction

Mucormycosis encompasses a spectrum of infections caused by fungi in the Order Mucormycotina with a  predisposition for causing aggressive rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary infections in severely immunocompromised hosts and patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Patient survival depends on early diagnosis, reversal of predisposing immunosuppressive risk factors and/or hyperglycemia, surgical resection of necrotic tissue when feasible, and the timely administration of effective systemic antifungal therapy. For more than 40 years, amphotericin B-based regimens have been the cornerstone for the treatment of mucormycosis, although the optimal dosing approach, particuliarly for liposomal amphotericin B,
