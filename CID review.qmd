# The Pharmacological Basis of Mucormycosis Therapy

## Introduction

Mucormycosis encompasses a spectrum of diseases caused by fungi in the order Mucorales that frequently present as aggressive, life-threatening pneumonia or rhino-orbital- cerebral infection in the severely immunocompromised or patients with poorly-controlled diabetes. Survival from the infection depends on the reversal of underlying predisposing metabolic or immunosuppressive conditions, surgical resection of infected tissue, and the timely administration of effective antifungal therapy [@Chamilos2008503;]. Challenges associated the early diagnosis and the limited number of effective treatment options recently lead the World Health Organization (WHO) to classified invasive mucormycosis as a fungal pathogen of "High Priority" for further research \[WHO citation\]

In the First International Henry Schueler Symposium, we examined how antifungal pharmacology and resistance differs for Mucorales versus more common *Aspergillus* infections[@lewis_etal12]. Since the publication of that supplement, new data have emerged concerning Mucorales species-specific susceptibility profiles, antifungal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), and investigational agents with possible efficacy against mucormycosis *in vivo*. In this monograph, we will review these recent data and highlight persistent areas of uncertainty regarding drug selection and dosing for mucormycosis that need to be addressed to better support treatment strategies for this devestating infection.
