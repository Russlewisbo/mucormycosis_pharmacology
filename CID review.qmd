## Abstract

## Introduction

Mucormycosis refers to a spectrum of diseases caused by fungi in the order Mucorales that frequently present as aggressive rhino-orbital- cerebral infections or pneumonia in the severely immunocompromised or diabetic patient. Survival from the infection often depends on reversal of underlying predisposing (immunosuppressive) conditions, surgical resection of infected tissue, and the timely administration of effective antifungal therapy before spreads or disseminates to other organs [@Chamilos2008503].

Amphotericin B has long been considered the drug of choice for mucormycosis with most clinicians over the last 20 years favouring administration of the less-nephrotoxic liposomal formulation at higher-doses (5-10 mg/kg/day) to rapidly load target tissues of the infection such as the lung and brain\[@groll_etal19\]. Patients are often switched to posaconazole or isavuconazole once the infection has stabilized, or if their is lack of clinical response or intolerance to amphotericin B \[@cornely_etal19a; @kontoyiannis_lewis11\]. However, there are no randomized trials assessing the efficacy of antifungal regimens for mucormycosis given the rarity of the infection.

Current antifungal treatment strategies/dosing for mucormycosis have been largely derived empirically from evidence translated from other invasive mold diseases such as aspergillosis, preclinical animal models, and limited observational case series or uncontrolled trials [@cornely_etal19a]. In the previous Henry Schuler Supplement on Mucormycosis [@lewis_etal12], we examined the possible
